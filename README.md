## Hi there, I'm Omar Essaid ðŸ‘‹

Full-stack Software Engineer and Data Scientist, passionate about code.

I have a strong engineering background and extensive experience as a Data Scientist. I've worked as a Tech/Data Science Lead for an AI consultancy called [Quantmetry](https://www.quantmetry.com/). I've helped several companies of various sizes (from small to Fortune 500) and from various industries (including cars, advertising, finance) with their Data Science challenges. That includes but is not limited to Times Series, NLP, Anomaly Detection, and Explainable AI techniques. I've used Python (Scikit-Learn, Keras, Spacy, Gensim, etc.) and Spark (PySpark, SparkML).

I've also been the Head of Forecasting for the French/Africa Consumer Healthcare business at [GSK](https://www.gsk.com/) (actually a joint venture with [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/)). I have also held a similar role for the European business of [Kimberly-Clark](https://www.kimberly-clark.com/).

I currently serve as CTO of [Moon Health](https://moonhealth.ai), an up-and-coming startup out of Paris that brings patients and health professionals closer through telemedicine. My role is to lead technological efforts both on software and data science. On a daily basis, I work with:
