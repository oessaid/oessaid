# Hi there, I'm Omar Essaid üëã

**TLDR**: Full-stack Software Engineer and Data Scientist, passionate about code. I have a strong engineering background and extensive experience as a Data Scientist.

## ‚åõ Things I've done:

‚öôÔ∏è I've worked as a **Tech/Data Science Lead** for an AI consultancy called [Quantmetry](https://www.quantmetry.com/). I've helped several companies of various sizes (from small to Fortune 500/CAC40) and from various industries (including cars, advertising, finance and manufacturing) with their Data Science challenges. That includes but is not limited to:

- Clustering and recommendation engines, 
- Time Series, 
- NLP, 
- Anomaly Detection, 
- and Explainable AI techniques.

I've used **Python (Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Spacy, Gensim, Prophet, etc.) and Spark (PySpark, SparkML).**

üíæ I've also co-authored an open-source PySpark package for ML pipelines called [pipeasy-spark](https://github.com/Quantmetry/pipeasy-spark) and I wrote [this gem](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MoonHealth.react-theme-faithful) of a VS Code plugin, which brings the color theme of React's website to your IDE, has been downloaded 4,3k times and has a single 5-star review (I swear it wasn't me). The funny thing is, I'm a unix shell absolutist and refuse to use anything other than (neo)Vim, so go figure.

üìñ I've also been part of the scientific review team of [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Lapprentissage-profond-French-Yoshua-Bengio-ebook/dp/B07JJ8NH24/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=l%27apprentissage+profond&qid=1608226541&sr=8-1), which is the French translation of [this eponymously named other book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472485235&sr=8-1&keywords=deep+learning+book) about Deep Learning, which itself has been described by Elon Musk as: 'written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.‚Äù I was in charge of Chapter 6, got myself credited in the book and my mom's very proud. It's all thanks to [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-bousquet-1bb0502/), who used to be my scientific director and is awesome.

‚öôÔ∏è I've also been the Head of Forecasting for the French/Africa Consumer Healthcare business at [GSK](https://www.gsk.com/) (actually a joint venture with [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/)). I have also held a similar role for the European business of [Kimberly-Clark](https://www.kimberly-clark.com/).

‚öôÔ∏è I currently serve as CTO of [Moon Health](https://moonhealth.ai), an up-and-coming startup out of Paris that brings patients and health professionals closer through telemedicine. My role is to lead technological efforts both on software and data science. 

## üî≠ Things I'm good at:

- Both actually coding stuff and leading teams/mentoring them into doing so, while getting better at it.

- **Data Science**, I've worked with all kinds of ML/DL frameworks, mostly in Python and Spark (see the intro above) but also in R (tidyverse/caret). I've done:
  - NER and sentiment analysis for a financial investment firm, 
  - pipelines for large scale (as in petabytes) data analysis/ML from connected cars, 
  - anomaly detection in supplier behaviour on a worldwide scale (again for a car manufacturer),
  - clustering/NLP/recommendations for a large classified advertisements website,
  - demand forecasting through ML for a manufacturing firm,
  - etc.

- **Typescript/Javascript, React, Redux (and Redux Toolkit)** on the frontend. I've worked with Vue.js as well, but I'd rather use React.

- **D3.js** and other data visualization frameworks (I'm loving [Visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/) from Airbnb these days).

- **React Native** and **Bluetooth Low Energy** (we interface with medical devices) protocols for mobile (iOS and Android).

- **Python/Django/PostgreSQL** on the backend. That includes **database schema design**.

- All kinds of tools around **servers, unix shells, testing, CI/CD, cloud deployments and code versioning** (yes, even an interactive git rebase or an [octopus merge](https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=139033182525831)).


## üå± Things I'm learning these days:

- Game development (Godot/GDScript, Unity/C#, C++/SDL2/OpenGL), also getting better at Pixel Art (I use Aseprite),

- Native mobile development (Swift and Kotlin/Java),

- Customizing my mechanical keyboard's firmware in C (I use a QWERTY ortholinear layout and proudly use a Planck if you're curious).
