# Hi there, I'm Omar Essaid üëã

**[TL;DR](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read#English)**: Full-stack Software Engineer and Data Scientist, passionate about code. I have a strong engineering background and extensive experience as a Data Scientist.

## üöß Things I'm doing:

‚öôÔ∏è I'm currently the Lead Game Backend Engineer at [Northern Lights Entertainment](https://nebulae.world) a video games studio in Paris, currently developing a Massively Multiplayer Astropolitcs game called Nebulae. I work mostly with Rust, but I dabble in Unity/C#.


## ‚åõ Things I've done:

‚öôÔ∏è I most recently served as CTO of [Moon Health](https://moonhealth.ai), an up-and-coming startup out of Paris that brings patients and health professionals closer through telemedicine. My role was to lead technological efforts both on software and data science (and also to actually code them, with the help of my awesome team). 

‚öôÔ∏è I've worked as a **Tech/Data Science Lead** for an AI consultancy called [Quantmetry](https://www.quantmetry.com/). I've helped several companies of various sizes (from small to Fortune 500/CAC40) and from various industries (including cars, advertising, finance and manufacturing) with their data science challenges. That includes but is not limited to:

- Clustering and recommendation engines, 
- Time Series, 
- NLP, 
- Anomaly Detection, 
- Explainable AI techniques (such as [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)).

I've used **Python (Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Spacy, Gensim, Prophet, etc.) and Spark (PySpark, SparkML).**

üíæ I've co-authored an open-source PySpark package for ML pipelines called [pipeasy-spark](https://github.com/Quantmetry/pipeasy-spark) and I wrote [this gem](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MoonHealth.react-theme-faithful) of a VS Code plugin, which brings the color theme of React's website to your IDE, has been downloaded 4,3k times and has a single 5-star review (I swear it wasn't me). The funny thing is, I'm a unix shell absolutist and refuse to use anything other than (neo)Vim, so go figure. 

Anyway, that's how I got that [Arctic Code Vault Contributor](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/) badge on the left.

üìñ I've been part of the scientific review team of [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Lapprentissage-profond-French-Yoshua-Bengio-ebook/dp/B07JJ8NH24/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=l%27apprentissage+profond&qid=1608226541&sr=8-1), which is the French translation of [this eponymously named other book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472485235&sr=8-1&keywords=deep+learning+book) about Deep Learning, which itself has been described by Elon Musk as: 'written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.‚Äù I was in charge of Chapter 6, got myself credited in the book and my mom's very proud. It's all thanks to [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-bousquet-1bb0502/), who used to be my scientific director and is awesome.

‚öôÔ∏è I've been the Head of Forecasting for the French/Africa Consumer Healthcare business at [GSK](https://www.gsk.com/) (actually a joint venture with [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/)). I have also held a similar role for the European business of [Kimberly-Clark](https://www.kimberly-clark.com/).

## üî≠ Things I'm good at:

Both actually coding stuff and leading teams/mentoring them into doing so, while getting them and myself better at it. That's a lot of pronouns. 

Anyway, I'm comfortable with GitFlow/GitHub Flow, the agile development process, and I advocate for [TDD](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) and [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).

Here's a list of things I can do:

- **Data Science**, I've worked with all kinds of ML/DL frameworks, mostly in Python and Spark (see the intro above) but also in R (tidyverse/caret). I've done:
  - NER and sentiment analysis for a financial investment firm, 
  - Pipelines for large scale (as in petabytes) data analysis/ML from connected cars, 
  - Anomaly detection in supplier behaviour on a worldwide scale (again for a car manufacturer),
  - Clustering/NLP/recommendations for a large classified advertisements website,
  - Demand forecasting through ML for a manufacturing firm,
  - etc.

- **Typescript/Javascript, React, Redux (and Redux Toolkit)** on the frontend. I've worked with Vue.js as well, but I'd rather use React.

- **D3.js** and other data visualization frameworks (I'm loving [Visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/) from Airbnb these days).

- **React Native** and **Bluetooth Low Energy** (we interface with medical devices) protocols for mobile (iOS and Android).

- **Python/Django/PostgreSQL** on the backend. That includes **database schema design**.

- All kinds of tools around **servers, unix shells, testing, CI/CD, cloud deployments and code versioning** (yes, even an interactive git rebase or an [octopus merge](https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=139033182525831)).


## üå± Things I'm learning these days:

- Game development (Godot/GDScript, Unity/C#, C++/SDL2/OpenGL), also getting better at Pixel Art (I use Aseprite),

- Native mobile development (Swift and Kotlin/Java),

- Customizing my mechanical keyboard's firmware in C (I use a QWERTY ortholinear layout and proudly use a [Planck](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck) if you're curious).
